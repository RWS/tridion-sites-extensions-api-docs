## ActivityInstancesQueryProps.forAllUsers property

When set to `false`<!-- -->, the results will be filtered on Assignee or Owner depending on the activity instance state: - Activity Instances in Assigned State are returned if they are assigned to the Current User or any groups of the Current User. - Activity Instances in other Activity States are returned if they are owned by the Current User

When set to `true`<!-- -->, the results are filtered by security instead. Only the Activity Instances on which the current user has Workflow Management rights (or system administration privileges) are returned.
