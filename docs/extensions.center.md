## Center variable

This components provides a convenient way to center its child components both vertically and horizontally using a flexbox layout. (see, for example, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS\_Flexible\_Box\_Layout).

It is advisable to construct most of the layout using this component as it allows to freely utilize "shouldFill" and similar props that rely on the parent being a Flex component.

**Signature:**

```typescript
Center: CenterComponent;
```
