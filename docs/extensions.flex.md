## Flex variable

The primary building block for layout, based on the principles of the flexible box layout module (see, for example, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS\_Flexible\_Box\_Layout).

It is advisable to construct most of the layout using this component as it allows to freely utilize "shouldFill" and similar props that rely on the parent being a Flex component.

**Signature:**

```typescript
Flex: FlexComponent;
```
