## MutationStatus type

-   `idle` initial status prior to the mutation function executing. - `loading` if the mutation is currently executing. - `error` if the last mutation attempt resulted in an error. - `success` if the last mutation attempt was successful.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export type MutationStatus = 'idle' | 'loading' | 'success' | 'error';
```
