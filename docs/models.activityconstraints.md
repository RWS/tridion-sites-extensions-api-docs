## ActivityConstraints type

Defines the constraints of an Activity Instance.

\* `none` - Does not have any constraints. \* `denyBundleMetadataEditing` - Denies editing Metadata of a Bundle in workflow. \* `denySubjectEditing` - Denies editing Subject in workflow. \* `denyAddRemoveWorkItem` - Denies adding/removing work items to/from the Activity. \* `unknownByClient` - \* Special reserved value used to notify an older API version client about the presence of an enumeration member added in a later API version. Explicitly setting this value by a client is not allowed, but client code should check it and be able to handle such cases.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export type ActivityConstraints =
    | 'none'
    | 'denyBundleMetadataEditing'
    | 'denySubjectEditing'
    | 'denyAddRemoveWorkItem'
    | 'unknownByClient';
```
