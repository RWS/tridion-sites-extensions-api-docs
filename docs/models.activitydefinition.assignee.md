## ActivityDefinition.assignee property

Gets or sets the User or Group to which the Workflow activity will be assigned.

Depending on the character of activity this property has some limitations: Assignee of the first activity in the process might not be set explicitly. In that case activity will be assigned to everyone. Automatic activities (activities with "TridionActivityDefinition.Script" property set) should be assigned to the workflow agent user (Id of this user can be found in Content Manager configuration under the 'Automatic Trustee ID' setting in the Workflow settings node).

If this property is not set or set to null, the value depends on the kind of activity: For normal activity the everyone group will be assigned. For decision activity a performer of the previous activity will be assigned. For automatic activity (activity with "TridionActivityDefinition.Script" property set) the workflow agent user will be assigned.

**Signature:**

```typescript
get assignee(): Link | undefined;
```
