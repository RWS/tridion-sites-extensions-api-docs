## ActivityState type

Defines a state of an Activity.

\* `assigned` - The Activity is assigned to the User or Group. \* `started` - The Activity is started by a User. \* `failed` - The Activity is failed. \* `finished` - The Activity is finished. \* `suspended` - The Activity is suspended. \* `waitingForWorkflowAgent` - The Activity is waiting for execution by Workflow Agent. \* `unknownByClient` - \* Special reserved value used to notify an older API version client about the presence of an enumeration member added in a later API version. Explicitly setting this value by a client is not allowed, but client code should check it and be able to handle such cases.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export type ActivityState =
    | 'assigned'
    | 'started'
    | 'failed'
    | 'finished'
    | 'suspended'
    | 'waitingForWorkflowAgent'
    | 'unknownByClient';
```
