## ApprovalStatus.isDeleted property

Value indicating whether the Approval Status is deleted.

If an Approval Status is deleted, it is not physically removed, but only flagged as deleted. (and therefore suppressed from the list of Approval Statuses).

**Signature:**

```typescript
get isDeleted(): boolean;
```
