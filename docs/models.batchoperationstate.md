## BatchOperationState type

The state of the batch operation.

\* `notStarted` - Batch operation wasn't started yet. \* `success` - Batch operation was successfully finished. \* `warning` - Batch operation was finished with warning. \* `error` - Batch operation wasn't finished due to an error. \* `unknownByClient` - Special reserved value used to notify an older API version client about the presence of an enumeration member added in a later API version. Explicitly setting this value by a client is not allowed, but client code should check it and be able to handle such cases.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export type BatchOperationState = 'notStarted' | 'success' | 'warning' | 'error' | 'unknownByClient';
```
