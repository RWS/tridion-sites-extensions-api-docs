## ComponentTemplate.priority property

Priority used for resolving Component links.

The Priority is used by Content Delivery linking to resolve a Component link: if a Component is published on multiple Pages, then a choice has to be made to which Page the hyperlink should point. This decision is made based on the Priority of the Component Template used to render the Component: the hyperlink will point to the Page containing a Component Presentation with the highest priority.

**Signature:**

```typescript
get priority(): number | undefined;
```
