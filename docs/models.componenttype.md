## ComponentType type

Defines the subtype of a Component.

\* `normal` - A normal Component containing XML content. \* `multimedia` - A Multimedia Component containing binary content. \* `widget` - A widget Component - a dedicated variant of the normal Component. \* 'unknownByClient' - Special reserved value used to notify an older API version client about the presence of an enumeration member added in a later API version. Explicitly setting this value by a client is not allowed, but client code should check it and be able to handle such cases.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export type ComponentType = 'normal' | 'multimedia' | 'widget' | 'unknownByClient';
```
