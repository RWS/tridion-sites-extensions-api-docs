## DeployerAction type

Represents the action the deployer needs to take.

Members: \* `commit` - The deployer should commit the transport package. \* `wait` - The deployer should wait to commit the transport package. \* `abort` - The deployer should abort the transport package. \* `unknownByClient` - Special reserved value used to notify an older API version client about the presence of an enumeration member added in a later API version. Explicitly setting this value by a client is not allowed, but client code should check it and be able to handle such cases.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export type DeployerAction = 'commit' | 'wait' | 'abort' | 'unknownByClient';
```
