## LoadInfoErrorType type

\* `none` - No error. \* `error` - General error. \* `security` - User has no permissions to read an item. \* `unknownByClient` - Special reserved value used to notify an older API version client about the presence of an enumeration member added in a later API version. Explicitly setting this value by a client is not allowed, but client code should check it and be able to handle such cases.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export type LoadInfoErrorType = 'none' | 'error' | 'security' | 'unknownByClient';
```
