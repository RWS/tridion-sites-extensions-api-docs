## LockType type

\* `none` - The item is not locked. \* `checkedOut` - The item is checked-out. This can mean either a temporary (edit) lock, a permanent lock (explicit check-out performed by user) or a workflow lock. \* `permanent` - The item is permanently locked, that is using an explicit lock (check-out) action. Can be applied to versioned items (permanent check-out) and to organizational items. \* `newItem` - The item is a new item, that is it has been created, but not checked-in for the first time yet. \* `inWorkflow` - The item is in a workflow. \* `reserved` - The item is reserved by the system. This means it is checked-out/locked, but nobody owns the lock. \* `unknownByClient` - Special reserved value used to notify an older API version client about the presence of an enumeration member added in a later API version. Explicitly setting this value by a client is not allowed, but client code should check it and be able to handle such cases.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export type LockType = 'none' | 'checkedOut' | 'permanent' | 'newItem' | 'inWorkflow' | 'reserved' | 'unknownByClient';
```
