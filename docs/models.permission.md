## Permission type

\* `none` - No permission to access the items. \* `read` - Grants read access to items. \* `write` - Grants write access to items. \* `delete` - Grants delete access to items. \* `localize` - Grants localize and unlocalize access to items. \* `all` - Grants all permissions to access the items. \* `unknownByClient` - Special reserved value used to notify an older API version client about the presence of an enumeration member added in a later API version. Explicitly setting this value by a client is not allowed, but client code should check it and be able to handle such cases.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export type Permission = 'none' | 'read' | 'write' | 'delete' | 'localize' | 'all' | 'unknownByClient';
```
