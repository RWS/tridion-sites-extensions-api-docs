## ProcessFinishReason type

Defines the reason a Process is going to be finished or has finished already.

\* `completedNormally` - Identifies if the process has finished normally. \* `forceFinished` - Identifies if the process was forcefully finished. \* `terminated` - Identifies if the process was terminated. \* `unknownByClient` - Special reserved value used to notify an older API version client about the presence of an enumeration member added in a later API version. Explicitly setting this value by a client is not allowed, but client code should check it and be able to handle such cases.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export type ProcessFinishReason = 'completedNormally' | 'forceFinished' | 'terminated' | 'unknownByClient';
```
