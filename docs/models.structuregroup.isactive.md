## StructureGroup.isActive property

Active state of the Structure Group. If the active state is set to false, the Structure Group and the items inside it cannot be published.

Even if the active state is set to "true", it is not enough for a Structure Group to be publishable; all of its ancestor Structure Groups must also have the active state set to "true" for that to succeed.

**Signature:**

```typescript
get isActive(): boolean;
```
