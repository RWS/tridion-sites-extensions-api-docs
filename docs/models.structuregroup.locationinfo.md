## StructureGroup.locationInfo property

Location/context information, including publish location.

Structure Groups act as a publish location, therefore their LocationInfo property is refined to "PublishLocationInfo".

**Signature:**

```typescript
get locationInfo(): PublishLocationInfo | undefined;
```
