## StructureGroup.pageProcess property

An associated Process Definition which defines the editing process for Pages in the Structure Group.

If a Page Process is specified, a workflow process based on this Process Definition will be started when a Page is saved. This process has to be finished before the Page will be checked in. Hence we refer to this as an editing process.

**Signature:**

```typescript
get pageProcess(): Link | undefined;
```
