## TranslationErrorSeverity type

Indicates the severity of an error sending or retrieving a Translation Job.

Members: \* `info` - Information. \* `warning` - Errors that can impact usability but does not impact sending or retrieving Items (for example old jobs not being deleted) \* `error` - Errors stopping Items from being send to translation or retrieved from translation. \* `unknownByClient` - Special reserved value used to notify an older API version client about the presence of an enumeration member added in a later API version. Explicitly setting this value by a client is not allowed, but client code should check it and be able to handle such cases.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export type TranslationErrorSeverity = 'info' | 'warning' | 'error' | 'unknownByClient';
```
