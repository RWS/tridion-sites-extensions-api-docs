## TranslationJobPriority type

Specifies the priority of the translation job. Higher priority jobs will be send to the TMS server first.

Members: \* `low` - Low priority \* `normal` - Normal priority \* `high` - High priority \* `unknownByClient` - Special reserved value used to notify an older API version client about the presence of an enumeration member added in a later API version. Explicitly setting this value by a client is not allowed, but client code should check it and be able to handle such cases.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export type TranslationJobPriority = 'low' | 'normal' | 'high' | 'unknownByClient';
```
