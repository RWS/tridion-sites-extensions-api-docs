## TranslationJobState type

State of a translation job.

Members: \* `canceled` - The job has been canceled. \* `definition` - The job is in definition state - it can still be edited. \* `readyForTranslation` - The job has been defined, and is waiting for the Translation Manager Service to retrieve it. \* `submittingToTranslation` - The job is being transferred to the translation management system. \* `inTranslation` - The job is under control of the translation management system. \* `completed` - The job has been completed. \* `readyForDeletion` - The job can be deleted and is waiting for the service to pick up the task. \* `deleting` - The job is currently being deleted. \* `none` - Unspecified state (used to get jobs for all states). \* `unknownByClient` - Special reserved value used to notify an older API version client about the presence of an enumeration member added in a later API version. Explicitly setting this value by a client is not allowed, but client code should check it and be able to handle such cases.
