## TranslationJobType type

The Translation job type (push or pull)

Members: \* `none` - Unspecified job type (used to get jobs for all types). \* `pushJob` - Job that pushes translation from one translation source to one or more targets. \* `pullJob` - Job that pulls the translation from one or more source languages to the context target. \* `unknownByClient` - Special reserved value used to notify an older API version client about the presence of an enumeration member added in a later API version. Explicitly setting this value by a client is not allowed, but client code should check it and be able to handle such cases.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export type TranslationJobType = 'none' | 'pushJob' | 'pullJob' | 'unknownByClient';
```
