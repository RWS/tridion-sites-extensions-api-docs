## TridionActivityDefinition.script property

Script of an automated Activity. A string that contains CSharp code.

An Activity Definition can represent an automated activity to which a script is associated. This script is then executed by the TCM Workflow Agent once the workflow process reaches the activity.

When you create a Process Definition, you can define an automatic Activity Definition simply by setting the Script property. You don't need to explicitly specify the "ActivityDefinition.Assignee", it will be automatically set to the TCM Workflow Agent during the creation of the Process Definition.

The TCM Workflow Agent user is declared in the TCM configuration in the workflow section as the following example illustrates:

**Signature:**

```typescript
get script(): string | undefined;
```

## Example

&amp;lt;configuration&amp;gt; &amp;lt;workflow workflowAgentAccountUri="tcm:0-3-65552" /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/configuration&amp;gt;
