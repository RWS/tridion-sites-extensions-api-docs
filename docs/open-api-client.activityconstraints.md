## ActivityConstraints enum

Defines the constraints of an Activity Instance.

Members: \* `None` - Does not have any constraints.

\* `DenyBundleMetadataEditing` - Denies editing Metadata of a Bundle in workflow.

\* `DenySubjectEditing` - Denies editing Subject in workflow.

\* `DenyAddRemoveWorkItem` - Denies adding/removing work items to/from the Activity.

\* `UnknownByClient` - Special reserved value used to notify an older API version client about the presence of an enumeration member added in a later API version. Explicitly setting this value by a client is not allowed, but client code should check it and be able to handle such cases.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export declare enum ActivityConstraints
```
