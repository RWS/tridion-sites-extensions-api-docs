## BatchOperationState enum

The state of the batch operation.

Members: \* `NotStarted` - Batch operation wasn't started yet.

\* `Success` - Batch operation was successfully finished.

\* `Warning` - Batch operation was finished with warning.

\* `Error` - Batch operation wasn't finished due to an error.

\* `UnknownByClient` - Special reserved value used to notify an older API version client about the presence of an enumeration member added in a later API version. Explicitly setting this value by a client is not allowed, but client code should check it and be able to handle such cases.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export declare enum BatchOperationState
```
