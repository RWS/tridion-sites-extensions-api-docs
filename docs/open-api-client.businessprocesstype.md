## BusinessProcessType type

Represents a Business Process Type: defines a type of (publishing) Business Process, including a set of publishing Target Types and workflows. It is a root organizational item. Title must be unique across its blueprint hierarchy; like all other root organizational items.

Metadata Schema, Bundle Schemas and Target Types of a Business Process Type are not localizable. AccessControlListData and IsPermissionsInheritanceRoot cannot be set for a Business Process Type. GetList and GetListXml return the associated "BundleSchemas".

When reading a Business Process Type the associated Target Types are returned without its Access Control List, if that information is needed, then, the Business Process Type should be loaded with LoadFlags.Expanded.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export type BusinessProcessType = OrganizationalItem & {
    BundleSchemas?: Array<Link>;
    CdTopologyTypeId?: string;
    Description?: string;
    TargetTypes?: Array<TargetType>;
};
```
