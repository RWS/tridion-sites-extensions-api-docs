## DeployerAction enum

Represents the action the deployer needs to take.

Members: \* `Commit` - The deployer should commit the transport package.

\* `Wait` - The deployer should wait to commit the transport package.

\* `Abort` - The deployer should abort the transport package.

\* `UnknownByClient` - Special reserved value used to notify an older API version client about the presence of an enumeration member added in a later API version. Explicitly setting this value by a client is not allowed, but client code should check it and be able to handle such cases.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export declare enum DeployerAction
```
