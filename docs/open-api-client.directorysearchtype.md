## DirectorySearchType enum

Search types for the Directory Group Mapping.

Members: \* `Subtree` - Search in the given subtree.

\* `Group` - Search in the given group.

\* `UnknownByClient` - Special reserved value used to notify an older API version client about the presence of an enumeration member added in a later API version. Explicitly setting this value by a client is not allowed, but client code should check it and be able to handle such cases.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export declare enum DirectorySearchType
```
