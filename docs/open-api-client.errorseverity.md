## ErrorSeverity enum

Indicates the severity of an error sending or retrieving a Translation Job.

Members: \* `Info` - Information.

\* `Warning` - Errors that can impact usability but does not impact sending or retrieving Items (for example old jobs not being deleted)

\* `Error` - Errors stopping Items from being send to translation or retrieved from translation.

\* `UnknownByClient` - Special reserved value used to notify an older API version client about the presence of an enumeration member added in a later API version. Explicitly setting this value by a client is not allowed, but client code should check it and be able to handle such cases.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export declare enum ErrorSeverity
```
