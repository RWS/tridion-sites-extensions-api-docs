## LoadInfoState enum

Enum of load states.

Members: \* `FullyLoaded` - An item is fully loaded.

\* `PartiallyLoaded` - An item is partially loaded.

\* `UnknownByClient` - Special reserved value used to notify an older API version client about the presence of an enumeration member added in a later API version. Explicitly setting this value by a client is not allowed, but client code should check it and be able to handle such cases.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export declare enum LoadInfoState
```
