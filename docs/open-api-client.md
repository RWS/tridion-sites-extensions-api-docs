| [WorkflowType](./open-api-client.workflowtype.md)                                             | Represents a data of Workflow Type.Different workflows are intended for different purposes (such as workflow process started automatically on editing item, project workflow where multiple items involved or task workflow process. The Workflow Type allows to distinguish workflow processes by their purpose. Predefined Workflow Types are: Unspecified (tcm:0-1-67584) (default), SystemStarted (tcm:0-2-67584) (set internally on saving of Component, Page, Component Template or Page Template if they have associated Process Definition) and Task (tcm:0-3-67584).Workflow types are read-only and can't be created/modified/deleted through API. Custom workflow types can be registered in the Tridion.ContentManager.config in the workflowTypes section.                     |
