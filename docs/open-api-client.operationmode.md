## OperationMode enum

Specifies the type of behavior when validation errors occur.

Members: \* `FailOnError` - Fails the operation in case of any validation error found (warnings are returned in the operation result, but do not break operation).

\* `FailOnWarning` - Fails the operation in case of any validation error or warning found.

\* `UnknownByClient` - Special reserved value used to notify an older API version client about the presence of an enumeration member added in a later API version. Explicitly setting this value by a client is not allowed, but client code should check it and be able to handle such cases.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export declare enum OperationMode
```
