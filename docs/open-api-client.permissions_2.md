## Permissions_2 enum

Specifies the Permissions used for security checks.

Members: \* `None` - No permission to access the items.

\* `Read` - Grants read access to items.

\* `Write` - Grants write access to items.

\* `Delete` - Grants delete access to items.

\* `Localize` - Grants localize and unlocalize access to items.

\* `All` - Grants all permissions to access the items.

\* `UnknownByClient` - Special reserved value used to notify an older API version client about the presence of an enumeration member added in a later API version. Explicitly setting this value by a client is not allowed, but client code should check it and be able to handle such cases.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export declare enum Permissions
