## ProcessFinishReason enum

Defines the reason a Process is going to be finished or has finished already.

Members: \* `CompletedNormally` - Identifies if the process has finished normally.

\* `ForceFinished` - Identifies if the process was forcefully finished.

\* `Terminated` - Identifies if the process was terminated.

\* `UnknownByClient` - Special reserved value used to notify an older API version client about the presence of an enumeration member added in a later API version. Explicitly setting this value by a client is not allowed, but client code should check it and be able to handle such cases.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export declare enum ProcessFinishReason
```
