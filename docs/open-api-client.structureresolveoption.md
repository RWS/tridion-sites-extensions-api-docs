## StructureResolveOption enum

Represents the option to include the resolved items and/or structure.

Members: \* `OnlyItems` - Only item(s) will be resolved. This is the default value.

\* `OnlyStructure` - Only Structure Group(s) will be resolved.

\* `ItemsAndStructure` - Structure Group(s) along with item(s) will be resolved.

\* `UnknownByClient` - Special reserved value used to notify an older API version client about the presence of an enumeration member added in a later API version. Explicitly setting this value by a client is not allowed, but client code should check it and be able to handle such cases.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export declare enum StructureResolveOption
```
