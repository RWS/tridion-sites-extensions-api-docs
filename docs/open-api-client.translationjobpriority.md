## TranslationJobPriority enum

Specifies the priority of the translation job. Higher priority jobs will be send to the TMS server first.

Members: \* `Low` - Low priority

\* `Normal` - Normal priority

\* `High` - High priority

\* `UnknownByClient` - Special reserved value used to notify an older API version client about the presence of an enumeration member added in a later API version. Explicitly setting this value by a client is not allowed, but client code should check it and be able to handle such cases.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export declare enum TranslationJobPriority
```
