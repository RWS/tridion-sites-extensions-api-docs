## TranslationJobState enum

State of a translation job.

Members: \* `Canceled` - The job has been canceled.

\* `Definition` - The job is in definition state - it can still be edited.

\* `ReadyForTranslation` - The job has been defined, and is waiting for the Translation Manager Service to retrieve it.

\* `SubmittingToTranslation` - The job is being transferred to the translation management system.

\* `InTranslation` - The job is under control of the translation management system.

\* `Completed` - The job has been completed.

\* `ReadyForDeletion` - The job can be deleted and is waiting for the service to pick up the task.

\* `Deleting` - The job is currently being deleted.

\* `None` - Unspecified state (used to get jobs for all states).

\* `UnknownByClient` - Special reserved value used to notify an older API version client about the presence of an enumeration member added in a later API version. Explicitly setting this value by a client is not allowed, but client code should check it and be able to handle such cases.

export declare enum TranslationJobState
