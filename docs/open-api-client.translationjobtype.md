## TranslationJobType enum

The Translation job type (push or pull)

Members: \* `None` - Unspecified job type (used to get jobs for all types).

\* `PushJob` - Job that pushes translation from one translation source to one or more targets.

\* `PullJob` - Job that pulls the translation from one or more source languages to the context target.

\* `UnknownByClient` - Special reserved value used to notify an older API version client about the presence of an enumeration member added in a later API version. Explicitly setting this value by a client is not allowed, but client code should check it and be able to handle such cases.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export declare enum TranslationJobType
```
